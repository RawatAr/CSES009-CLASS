Event driven architecture is a design pattern  where flow of application is determined by event, such as user adminnistration.

.on(Event,Listener), it registred a event.

.emit(Event,data), triggers the event

EventEmitter is stringed based

off--emits nothing
on--emits every time when called
once--emits only once (doesn't matter how many time it has been called)

http = hyper text transfer protocol
(browser) and server to talk

http statelessness -- it means server doesn't remember any of it's prevoius request, each request will be independent.

Privous request, user data, login state--for that we use session, cookies and token to store data.

#HTTP REQUEST STRUCTURE
1. METHOD
2. URL
3. HEADER
4. BODY (optional) 


3. HEADER--extra information, eg like ("Conten_type"), application/json, content type, 
used for--authorization, data format and caching

4.BODY-- contains actual data, it can only send by POST, PUT, PATCH

SERVER-RESPONSE--
1.Status code
2. Header
3.Body

Node js follows event drive architecture, we don't handle request manually, we register an listener

Http module is a bulletein we use to create 
Points, Response Header

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Lovely Professional University
        with experience in web development, backend systems, and software projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have worked as a freelance content writer and interned in technical roles,
        which helped me develop strong communication, research, and teamwork skills
        alongside my technical foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I actively participate in technical events, debates, and competitive platforms,
        and I believe in consistent learning through hands-on project work.
